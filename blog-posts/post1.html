        <h1>Why I’m Documenting My AI Journey</h1>
        <h2>Personal Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          Hey, my name is Cameron Kuykendall, and this is my blog. A few years
          ago, I committed myself to stop all my bad habits and form genuine,
          healthy goals. I wrote a book called
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.amazon.com/Concise-Short-Guide-Massive-Change/dp/B0D8HFBG51"
            ><em>"A Short Guide to Massive Change"</em></a
          >, if anyone is curious to read it. The book focuses on how our belief
          systems are the reasons we succeed or fail. A major part of what I
          decided to change was related to my career. What do I focus on? How do
          I make more money? These are common questions that many people aging
          out of their 20s and into their 30s might ask.
        </p>

        <p>
          After much self-reflection, I settled on computer science as my
          target. The salaries are great, and there are so many different
          avenues to pursue. I could work for NASA and send probes into space,
          looking for life on the moons of Jupiter. I could develop the next big
          app that everyone is talking about. However, my main interest lies in
          the controversial topic of AI.
        </p>

        <p>
          What is this thing that everyone loves to hate? That could destroy or
          change the world we live in. I’m set on finding out. How can it change
          the world? How can I change the world with it? Is it all that the
          movies have made it out to be? I <strong>will</strong> find out—and
          hopefully support my family in the process.
        </p>

        <h2>Learning in Public</h2>
        <p>
          Staying accountable to our goals can be one of the world's hardest
          tasks. Why? Because, well… no one cares about you. I mean, they do,but
          they don’t. I’m not trying to take a pessimistic view but rather a
          self-confident one. No one is going to help you—you have to help
          yourself. Keeping yourself accountable is crucial to any goal, career,
          or otherwise.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started this blog to keep myself accountable while hopefully
          inspiring others to do the same. This blog isn’t just for me; it's to
          prove that learning a skill is: 1. possible, and 2. very messy,
          nonlinear, and—at its core—human. It's what we do.
        </p>

        <h2>Community, Opportunities, and Long-Term Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Documenting my journey from a computer science student to a
          professional will accomplish many things for me. This process involves
          collaboration and conversation, as I plan to interview others in the
          field. It will also help me stand out to future employers. I decided I
          didn’t just want to be someone they <em>hired</em> but someone they
          looked at and said, “We <strong>need</strong> that person on our
          team.” This self-reflective blog will help me achieve that goal.
        </p>

        <p>
          Speaking of goals, I want to show others that if someone like me
          (**see book above for more info**) can do it, anyone can.
        </p>

        <p>
          The last point I’ll make before I take off back into the world is
          this: I’m not doing this just to make more money—though that would be
          nice—but to change the world in a positive way. By helping others
          achieve their goals and by finding the most ethical, sustainable, and
          realistic ways to utilize the future of computing, I believe I can be
          part of changing the world for the better. This blog is both my
          manifesto and my journey.
        </p>

        <p>What will I discover in the process? Let's find out.</p>
