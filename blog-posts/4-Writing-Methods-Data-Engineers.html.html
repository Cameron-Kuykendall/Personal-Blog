        <h1>The Wonderful World of Data and Its Writing Methods</h1>
        <p>
          <em
            >The perfect introduction to get my readers oh so excited to
            read!</em
          >
        </p>

        <h2>An Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Data Science, Data Engineering, Machine Learning, AI engineers– When
          these words are said aloud, they bring up wondrous images of grandeur.
          It reminds us to love each other, and reminds us that we are one
          people in a beautiful land, connected by the prosperity of our future…
          Not quite. In fact, it usually brings to mind images of long hours,
          dark office spaces, and hunched-backed workers slowly sipping their
          fifth cup of coffee.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is some confusion surrounding Data and AI engineers and what
          they do on a day-to-day basis. Since this career is one that I may
          pursue, I decided to grab a bite of what it means to be a data
          scientist and present that information to you, specifically, regarding
          the types of writing they may do. I assume they mostly write code, but
          I am sure there is peer-to-peer documentation of some sort. This
          research helps me understand data engineering and gives you a glimpse
          into its world.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>NOTE 1:</strong> I believe that writing is one of the most
          educational things you can do. It benefits both the author (me) and
          the reader (you). If I can explain these concepts to you in a simple
          fashion, that means I ACTUALLY understand it, so let’s see how this
          goes.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>NOTE 2:</strong> Throughout this blog, I will reference
          numerous articles, Reddit posts, research papers, and documentation
          papers. I have listed the citations below the page so you know I am
          not just spitballing–but please don’t blame me if I do.
        </p>

        <h2>Public Forums – The Most Celebrated Part of the Internet</h2>
        <p>
          I began my research where most research begins, Google. A good place
          to begin understanding what data scientists do and how much they write
          is to consult the source directly. If you haven’t heard of Reddit,
          it’s probably a good thing. Reddit is a worldwide forum site where you
          can find any kind of sub-topic you want; I mean, anything you want
          (parents, watch your kids). With the good, always comes the bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, I went to the subreddit
          <strong>r/dataengineering</strong>. I found a post:
          <em>How much reporting do you do as a DE?</em> Perfect. The top
          comment, with 37 likes, stated: “none.” The next top post with 25
          likes stated: “none, I moved into DE from Analytics so I can avoid
          creating (customer/stakeholder facing) reports.” The third post:
          “none.” The fourth post: “A lot, unfortunately.” There we go! Bet you
          weren’t expecting that—I wasn’t. After reading most of the comments,
          it appears that most of these employees do not write reports or tend
          to avoid writing anything at all; however, there is always an outlier
          in every research study. It must not be their cup of tea.
        </p>

        <h2>Articles - The Opinion of One, Read by Many</h2>
        <p>
          After going back to Google and continuing my search, looking for other
          types of documentation that Data scientists may actually perform, I
          came across an article on Medium.com by Olexiy Oryeshko titled
          <em>Design documents for ML models</em>. Okay, here is a different
          kind of writing—a “design document.” After reading the article, it
          became clear that this type of writing is deeply embedded in the
          culture of professional data engineers, and it has everything to do
          with understanding the reasons behind the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turns out, data engineers want to get paid money, and companies
          typically don’t want to spend money. Sometimes, the outcome of the
          data isn’t worth the money put into a given program. This is where
          design documents come in handy. It's a method of creating a plan
          before executing, which happens way more than you think in the general
          world of computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
          A design document is created for a few main reasons. It ensures the
          team is solving the right problem. It communicates to the company the
          purpose of the research. It also informs the company of the expected
          cost, risks, and expected results. Lastly, the document provides
          (mostly) accurate timelines, metrics, and the type of Machine Learning
          Model they will use for the project. These documents tend to have a
          professional and clear tone, as to get their point across quickly.
        </p>

        <h2>Other Findings - AI &amp; Ethics</h2>
        <p>
          AI ethics is a hotly debated topic. After searching for information
          regarding Data Engineers, which AI is a large part of, I found many
          articles discussing the use and ethics of AI. This ethics conversation
          is generally focused on the issues of stealing and not citing others'
          work, particularly in the art realm. There is, of course, more to this
          story. AI is a broad field that enables machines to learn from data
          and make intelligent decisions or predictions. Now, what happens if
          the data is… well, wrong?
        </p>
        <p>
          AI systems often make bad predictions when trained on flawed data.
          When I say “flawed data,” I mean many things. This data could come
          from biased sources. For example, if an AI were to be a judge in court
          and made decisions on prison time for criminals, and it was trained on
          racist data that tended to give people of color longer sentences, it
          would, in turn, also tend to give people of color longer sentences.
          This is one of the most important aspects of ethics in AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that I have gotten that out of the way, I will focus back on the
          topic of writing. Who does this research? Who writes it? It turns out
          that this is an emerging field of writing and research. These jobs are
          often referred to as AI Ethics Researcher, Ethics &amp; AI Policy
          Analyst, among other names. These individuals are committed to
          ensuring that every AI system implemented by any company is thoroughly
          inspected and free from biased information. They tend to do the most
          writing and research out of any job in the AI and DATA world. These
          papers can be long and full of information—as they should be. The
          writing and work they do is VERY important.
        </p>

        <h2>Data and the World of Writing</h2>
        <p>
          Before this project, I thought data engineers mostly coded. I knew
          that documentation was required. But I didn’t realize how much
          planning and communication go into their work, especially through
          technical writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clearly, opinions differ on how much writing AI engineers actually do.
          It seems the most used type of writing is usually some form of a
          technical document. These documents are typically used for
          communication among teams as well as with companies. There is an
          emerging field of AI ethics that also conducts thorough investigations
          and publishes well-researched papers.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you made it through this, I congratulate you. Data isn’t the most
          glamorous subject, but it quietly powers everything around us.
        </p>
