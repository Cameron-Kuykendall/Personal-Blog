        <h1>Is AI Bad for the Enviroment?</h1>
        <h2>The Hot Topic vs Actual Influential Topic</h2>

        <p>
          Lately, AI has become the hot topic in countless debates — from
          AI-generated <em>art</em> to AI relationships. I have my own concerns
          about many of these topics. But one issue keeps surfacing: the
          environmental impact of AI and, more broadly, how modern human life
          affects the planet.
        </p>

        <h2>The Conversation</h2>
        <p>
          The concept of <em>normalization</em> tells us this: over time,
          repeated behaviors, ideas, or systems, no matter how harmful, become
          accepted as “normal” through repetition and cultural reinforcement.
          Once something is normalized, we stop questioning it.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what does this have to do with AI? Everything. Humans tend to look
          for scapegoats, it’s easier to blame the new and unfamiliar. Headlines
          like “AI IS DESTROYING THE WORLD” trigger fear and anger, especially
          when paired with concerns about job loss. It makes sense. But when we
          react emotionally, we tend to overlook bigger, older problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          This article is about shining a light on what we often ignore. Let's
          talk about water, specifically, how we use it.
        </p>

        <h2>The Water Problem: <em>The Beef Industry</em></h2>
        <p>
          One of the first criticisms people throw at AI is its water usage,
          especially for cooling servers. That’s valid, especially in the
          context of growing water scarcity. But let’s compare that to some of
          our <em>normalized</em> industries.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Note: These figures are based on global averages. Actual usage
            varies by region and production methods. Links to articles and
            information are listed at the bottom</em
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Producing just <em>1 pound</em> of beef takes anywhere from 441 to
          12,000 gallons of water, depending on the method used (Source: Kai
          Olson-Sawyer, “Beef: The King of the Big Water Footprint”). We’ll use
          a mid range, and acceptable estimate of 1,800 gallons per pound to
          keep things conservative. Since 1 lb ≈ 0.45 kg, that comes out to:
        </p>
        <p><em>13,626 liters per kilogram of beef</em></p>
        <img class="blog-img-embed" src="/blog-posts/blog-post-3-img/water-chart.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          Global meat consumption is around 60 million metric tons per year,
          according to the USDA. That’s about
          <em>164,000 metric tons per day</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Total daily water use for meat = 164,000 tons × 1,000 kg/ton × 13,626
          liters/kg × 0.264172 gallons/liter<br />
          ≈ <strong>590,335,658,208 gallons per day</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Let that sink in: nearly 600 billion gallons of water used every day
          for meat — and most people don’t blink an eye. Why? Because
          <em>it’s normalized</em>. But that leads to a bigger question: how do
          we even have that much water? The truth is — we kind of don’t.
        </p>

        <p>So where does this water come from?</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rainwater</strong>: used to grow feed crops</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Irrigation</strong>: pumped from rivers, lakes, aquifers
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Blue Water</strong>: directly drawn from freshwater sources
          </li>
          <li><strong>Green Water</strong>: rain stored in soil</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Grey Water</strong>: water that’s been used and requires
            treatment
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>The problem:</strong> A lot of this water is being depleted
          faster than it can be replenished. Meat agriculture is the #1 driver
          of aquifer depletion, river drying, and wetland loss.
        </p>

        <h2>AI Water Use</h2>
        <p>
          Finding hard numbers on AI water use is tough because the industry is
          still emerging. But one estimate from Shaolei Ren et al., in “Making
          AI Less Thirsty,” suggests that by 2027, AI could be responsible for
          4.2 to 6.6 billion cubic meters of water withdrawals per year.
        </p>
        <p>Let’s use the high end for context:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>6.6 billion m³ = 6.6 trillion liters</li>
          <li>6.6 trillion liters ≈ 1.7435 trillion gallons/year</li>
          <li>
            1.7435 trillion ÷ 365 ≈ <strong>4.77 billion gallons/day</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>That sounds like a lot, and no doubt it is. But compared to beef?</p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >Beef: 590 billion gallons/day<br />AI: 4.77 billion
            gallons/day</strong
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s about <strong>120 times more water used for beef</strong>. And
          that doesn’t even include the fact that beef is responsible for
          roughly <strong>6% of total global greenhouse gas emissions</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet the outrage seems focused on AI. Why? Because it's new, not
          normalized yet, and therefore easier to blame.
        </p>

        <h2>So What Now?</h2>
        <p>
          If you’re concerned about the environment and think AI is part of the
          problem, your not wrong. But maybe ask yourself this: Have you cut out
          beef yet?
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not here to tell you what to eat. But if you're going to use
          environmental impact as an argument, it makes sense to start with the
          industries doing the most damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're worried about AI replacing jobs, or the psychological impact
          of constant automation, that's a different and important conversation.
          One I might dive into in a future post.
