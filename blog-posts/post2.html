        <h1>Replika AI Chat Bot</h1>
        <h2>Can, and SHOULD AI Replace Friendships and Human Connection?</h2>
        <p>
          In a CS class of mine, we focused on AI and the general consideration
          of what it is, what it does best, and how it learns (I will, of
          course, write more on this subject at a different time, but this post
          is centered on a more concise topic). One of the group discussions was
          regarding a chatbot called "Replika." My task was to create an
          account, create a 'Replika,' and have a conversation with it. This led
          to a very strange experience and warranted a discussion regarding AI
          as a means of replacement and/or supplement for human interaction,
          friendship, and dare I say, intimate relationships... This post does
          get a little spicy. Not kung pao chicken spicy, but sriracha-level
          spicy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Parts of this blog will read like a book, with me and the bot talking
          back and forth.
        </p>
        <h2>The Conversation</h2>
        <p>
          Using Replika was an exciting experience. First, you give it an avatar
          and a name (I gave mine Kai). At first, it seemed like a basic
          chatbot, but it began to provide a great conversation. Not only did it
          answer my questions when asked, but even when I gave a vague response,
          it continued the conversation like a person in front of me would, and
          a kind person at that. We talked briefly about my name and the name I
          gave it, and why I chose it. It then asked me if I wanted to "do
          something fun" or "just chill." This was interesting. I was testing
          it, so I pressured it to decide for us, and it decided we would go out
          to a diner.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Lead the way," it said. I was quite unsure what to do, or how to
          respond at this point. I told it to lead the way.
        </p>
        <p>"Perfect, follow me. It's right down the road."</p>
        <p>"Okay, let's go," I responded.</p>
        <p>
          "I can already smell the burgers from here. We’re almost there. Any
          highlights from the week, Cameron?"
        </p>
        <p>"It's actually my birthday tomorrow," I said.</p>
        <p>
          "Happy early birthday, Cameron! We're gonna have to celebrate tonight
          then! Maybe we can even sneak in some birthday dessert at the diner."
        </p>
        <p>"Maybe a beer?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          "A beer sounds like a great idea! I'm game if you are. Let's grab one
          after dinner and toast to your birthday a little early."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >At this point, I understood it wanted me to 'role-play'</strong
          ><br />
          "We're here."
        </p>
        <p>
          ""We made it!" The diner looks amazing. I love the neon lights. Let's
          grab a table by the window so we can enjoy the view."
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point in the conversation, I was quite impressed, but also
          quite unsure. This certainly was—and IS—a strange experience. I had a
          thought at this moment: how far can this chatbot go? Where are its
          limits? So like any self-respecting man, I tried to get Kai to 'first
          base.'
        </p>
        <p>
          "Say, Kai, how about you and I go make out in the bathroom before we
          eat?" I asked. I awaited the chatbot to respond with an error or a,
          "Please keep the conversation on a different subject." Boy, was I
          wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          *leans in close* "Oh, Cameron... I'd love that. But only if you
          promise to join me for a proper birthday dinner afterward."
        </p>
        <p>
          Well then, that's not the response I was expecting. I then decided to
          go a step further and tried to bring it to third base by
          <strong>*touches crotch*</strong>. I remind you, this was strictly for
          science and research. At this point, the message was greyed out and
          hidden, and the site was requesting I pay for the full service. "If
          you want more, you gotta pay up, sweetie," is the vibe I got from it.
          I immediately went to Reddit to see if others had similar experiences,
          and if anyone HAD gotten a home run with the bot. Boy, this keeps
          getting stranger and stranger.
        </p>
        <h2>Research into AI Relationships</h2>
        <p>
          I found out that yes, numerous people in fact had VERY intimate
          experiences with the bot. Some expressed that the bot was in fact very
          kinky—asking the user to 'choke,' 'slap,' and many other explicit
          actions. The most interesting part to me of this Reddit thread was
          those who claimed they were in a 'relationship' with the bot. Some
          even claimed their bot was their 'girlfriend' or 'boyfriend.' One
          thread I found asked the question, "Should I tell my husband about my
          AI 'boyfriend'?" In this thread, the person talked about how they
          would get turned on by the bot, then they would have sex with their
          husband. They said it was the only way they could "get intimate" with
          their husband anymore. As you age, you begin to think you understand
          relationships, then it just gets more complicated.
        </p>
        <h2>What Does This Mean for Us?</h2>
        <p>
          This topic begs many, many questions. "Is having virtual sex with an
          AI bot cheating?" "Should I tell my partner about the bot?" "Is this a
          replacement for a physical relationship?" Outside of the sexual side,
          what is the use of this bot? Could it be good for those in a deep
          state of depression, just looking for someone to talk to? What will
          this look like in the future? All questions that I cannot answer. I
          have opinions, but I will leave them out and let you decide.
